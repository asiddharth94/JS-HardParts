In Javascript, functions are 'functions' and 'objects'.

------- ALL FUNCTIONS ARE FUNCTION-OBJECT COMBOS. ALL! --------

As soon as we declare our function, the fn body gets attached to the fn label, and plus, an object
also gets attached to the label.

We could access the function part with the help of (), whereas the object part with dot notation.

So, when we declare a function (or, you could say our function-object combo) -
    the object part gets a property "prototype", which is again an empty object.

This is the place which we might want to use to put all our functions in. (functionStore in our example)

*** BY DEFAULT, ALL FUNCTIONS HAVE A PROPERTY ON THEIR OBJECT VERSION KNOWN AS "prototype",
which is itself an empty object ***

new keyword - 
    1. creates an empty object when the function is invoked, which we could access with 'this'
    2. add the property __proto__ which links to the 'prototype' property (where we can put our functions)
       of the object part of the function which is invoked to create these objects
    3. returns the created object

*** the things marked with blue pen in the above image are done automatically by the 'new' keyword

*** NOW, WE'VE A FANCY NAME FOR THIS FUNCTION-OBJECT COMBO --- "CLASS" ***
